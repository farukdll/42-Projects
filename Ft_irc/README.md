## KVIRC Protocols ? <a name="protocols"></a>
KVIrc is an IRC client that allows you to connect to IRC servers and engage in chat using the IRC protocol exclusively. KVIrc is an open-source and cross-platform client.

1. `IRC Protocol Support` : KVIrc supports the IRC protocol and is used to connect to IRC servers. Since IRC is a text-based protocol, KVIrc facilitates communication between the server and the client through text-based messages.
2. `Connection and Authentication` : KVIrc enables users to connect to IRC servers by sending identification information, such as a username and password, to authenticate themselves.
3. Server Settings: Users can add and configure IRC servers through KVIrc. Server name, port number, connection type, and other settings are configured in this section.
4. `Channel Joining and Messaging` : Using KVIrc, users can join channels and chat with other users. The list of channels, commands for joining channels, and the messaging interface within channels are all accessible through KVIrc's user interface.
5. `Private Messages` : KVIrc allows users to send and receive private messages to/from other users. This feature is used to communicate with other users one-on-one.
6. `Commands and Functions` : KVIrc supports basic commands and functions of the IRC protocol. Commands and functions such as joining channels, leaving channels, authentication, and obtaining user lists are all included in KVIrc.
7. `Automatic Responses and Response Handling` : KVIrc can automatically process and display responses received from the server. Responses are used to validate users' messages or actions.
8. `Settings and Preferences` : KVIrc allows users to configure their personal preferences. Users can customize the interface appearance, colors, default channels, and other preferences.
9. `Client Management` : KVIrc can manage and switch between multiple connections to work on multiple servers simultaneously.
10. `Scripting Support` : KVIrc provides users with scripting support using languages like Python and Perl. Users can create their own plugins and commands within KVIrc using these scripting languages.
